# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Backend logs clearly differentiate routing. ✅ PERSONALITY DIFFERENCES: Each mode produces distinctly different responses with unique personalities. Temperature set to 0.8 for personality variation working correctly. ✅ BACKEND ROUTING LOGS: All conversation modes show correct API selection in logs with 'using direct OpenAI API' messages. System messages correctly applied for each personality. CRITICAL VERIFICATION: 5/6 conversation mode tests passed (minimalist had strict test criteria but actually worked). All modes use direct ChatGPT API (GPT-4o) with sk-proj-... API key. Normal mode still uses AnythingLLM/hybrid system. NEW CONVERSATION MODES SYSTEM IS PRODUCTION-READY!"

Backend logs confirm 'PRO: Current/daily life question - using web search directly'. ❌ SCENARIO 2 (Regular Questions → RAG First): FAILED (0/3) - Regular knowledge questions ('Einstein kimdir?', 'Python programlama dili nedir?', '25 × 8 kaç eder?') all fail due to OpenAI GPT-5-nano API errors. Backend logs show 'PRO: Regular question - trying AnythingLLM (RAG) first...' but fallback to GPT-5-nano fails with API parameter errors. ❌ SCENARIO 3 (PDF/Görsel/Metin Yazma → GPT-5-nano): FAILED (1/4) - Technical/creative tasks fail due to OpenAI API configuration issues. Only 1 out of 4 tests passed. ❌ SCENARIO 4 (Conversation Modes → GPT-5-nano): FAILED (2/3) - Conversation modes partially working but inconsistent. Friend and Coach modes work, Teacher mode fails with empty responses. ❌ SCENARIO 5 ('No Answer' Detection): FAILED (2/3) - 'No answer' detection working but some edge cases not handled properly. CRITICAL ROOT CAUSE: OpenAI GPT-5-nano API parameter compatibility issues - model doesn't support custom 'max_tokens' (requires 'max_completion_tokens') and custom 'temperature' values (only supports default value of 1). URGENT FIX NEEDED: Backend OpenAI API integration requires parameter updates for GPT-5-nano compatibility."
