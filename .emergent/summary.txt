The AI engineer has transformed the BİLGİN application into a sophisticated hybrid AI system. Initially, the focus was on UI enhancements, chat history, RAG integration with AnythingLLM and Serper API, and basic file uploads. A significant phase involved implementing a Free/Pro versioning system, routing queries to various LLM providers (AnythingLLM, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, and later Novita DeepSeek v3.1). Debugging  and  issues were critical. Recent work heavily focused on extensive UI/UX refinements, including font changes, dynamic text adjustments, multi-line input, responsive chat display, and addressing persistent image/PDF processing errors by refactoring Vision API calls. The current development is centered on implementing real-time streaming responses and further aligning the left sidebar UI with user-provided design examples. Continuous user feedback has driven iterative improvements and bug fixes throughout this trajectory.

<product_requirements>
The BİLGİN application aims to be an AI chat assistant akin to ChatGPT, powered primarily by AnythingLLM, with robust RAG and real-time information capabilities. Key requirements include: a modern UI/UX with LaTeX rendering, vertical tabs for Normal Sohbet and Konuşma Modları, chat history, and anonymous usage. The core intelligence is a hybrid RAG system using AnythingLLM for contextual knowledge and Serper API for current events, with refined conditional routing. The app must process PDF, Word, Excel, and image files for analysis using LLMs, displaying them as clickable thumbnails in chat. A Free/Pro versioning system dynamically routes queries: PRO uses advanced LLMs (Novita DeepSeek v3.1 for general, AnythingLLM for RAG/formulas, Serper for current events) and FREE uses cost-effective LLMs (Ollama AnythingLLM). Critical UI updates include dynamic text sizing, auto-resizing multi-line input, a stop button, proper math rendering, and a redesigned left sidebar. Responses must be streamed with a typewriter effect, and conversation titles should be auto-generated and persistent.

<pending_tasks>
-   Apply DeepSeek v3.1 parameters (, , etc.) in the backend's Novita API call.
-   Address the Invalid Date display issue for conversation titles in the frontend.
-   Complete the frontend implementation and testing of the streaming response (typewriter effect) to ensure seamless chunk-by-chunk display.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on three key improvements:
1.  **Real Streaming Implementation (Chunk by Chunk):** The backend was updated to use  in the  function and to handle streaming responses. The new streaming endpoint () in  was also updated for chunk-by-chunk delivery.
2.  **Left Sidebar UI Upgrade:** CSS () was being modified to match a user-provided UI example, specifically updating the sidebar's width, padding, colors, and font sizes. Similar styling was applied to conversation history items for both normal and modes conversations in .
3.  **Frontend Streaming Implementation:** The  function in  was being updated to consume the new streaming endpoint and display incoming chunks of text in real-time, creating a typewriter effect.

The last action recorded was the AI engineer stating they would restart the backend and test these changes, but this step was not yet executed.

<optional_next_step>
Restart the backend, complete frontend streaming integration, apply DeepSeek parameters, and thoroughly test streaming and UI.
