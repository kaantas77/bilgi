The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily involved addressing persistent issues with the BİLGİN application's chat functionality and API connectivity, followed by implementing a significant new feature and starting a major UI refactor. Key challenges included fixing math rendering (resolved with KaTeX), debugging a broken authentication flow (which ultimately led to its removal), and rectifying repeated API connection errors. The developer transitioned the frontend from relying on a local FastAPI backend to directly integrating with the external AnythingLLM API, necessitating numerous changes to state management and API calls in . The final stage involved enhancing conversation modes with more natural responses and commencing a substantial UI redesign for the main chat layout.

<product_requirements>
The BİLGİN application aims to be an AI-powered chat similar to ChatGPT, leveraging the AnythingLLM API.
Initially, core requirements included:
1.  **Core Chat Functionality**: Interaction with AnythingLLM, supporting query/chat modes.
2.  **ChatGPT-like UI/UX**: Sidebar for conversations, dynamic chat titles, chat deletion.
3.  **Membership System**: Email/password, Google OAuth, email verification, admin panel, post-registration onboarding.
4.  **Settings Menu**: Report Bug, User Agreement, theme, and language toggles.
5.  **Mathematics Rendering**: Display complex mathematical symbols and formulas professionally (LaTeX quality).

During this trajectory, the user's explicit requests and the implemented changes evolved to:
1.  **Enhanced Math Rendering**: Display mathematical symbols and operations professionally in chat, similar to LaTeX quality. This was fully implemented.
2.  **Removal of Auth/Admin**: Explicit request to remove the entire membership system and admin panel to simplify the application, leading to anonymous chat access.
3.  **Conversation Modes**: Add a Konuşma Modları (Conversation Modes) section with distinct interaction styles: Friendly, Realistic, Coach, Lawyer, Teacher, Minimalist. This section should have its own chat logic and not interfere with the normal chat flow.
4.  **Natural Mode Responses**: Make conversation mode responses more natural and concise.
5.  **UI Layout Refactor**: Redesign the main chat interface to have Normal Sohbet and Konuşma Modları sections stacked vertically, with a wider chat frame and separate, distinct chat areas for each.

        -   Updated  usage to environment variable.
        -   Modified  model to include .
        -   Adjusted  endpoint to incorporate  and always send  to AnythingLLM (as AnythingLLM only supports chat or query).
        -   *Significant change*: Auth dependencies () were removed from conversation-related endpoints (, ), allowing anonymous access.
        -   Later, the frontend was adapted to directly call AnythingLLM, effectively bypassing this backend for core chat functionality.
        -    added for debugging API calls.
-   **/app/backend/.env**:
    -   **Summary**: Stores environment variables like , , , .
    -   **Changes Made**:  was repeatedly updated with new keys provided by the user.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The central React component handling state, routing, all main screens, and global UI logic. This file underwent the most substantial changes.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Integrated  component.
        -   Extensively modified for ,  styles (later removed).
        -   Fixed  configuration for  headers.
        -   *Major refactor*: Removed all authentication, membership, and admin panel-related logic and UI.
        -   Implemented  (Conversation Modes) with state (, , ).
        -   Updated  to include  for LLM prompting.
        -   Integrated tab system for Normal Sohbet and Konuşma Modları.
        -   Modified chat input placeholders and info text based on selected mode.
        -   *Crucial change*: Modified API calls from  to  and changed target from local FastAPI backend to direct AnythingLLM API (using ).
        -   Debugged and fixed React state management issues ( resetting) using  and  dependency arrays.
        -   Introduced temporary test buttons and logging for debugging.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the UI layout refactor for Normal Sohbet and Konuşma Modları sections to be stacked vertically with wider frames and separate chat areas.
-   Refine the prompting logic for Conversation Modes to ensure more natural and concise responses, especially since the frontend is now directly interacting with AnythingLLM.
-   Ensure all existing features (math rendering, conversation modes, chat functionality) remain stable after the UI refactor.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of a major UI redesign based on the user's explicit request. The user asked for the Normal Sohbet and Konuşma Modları sections to be displayed vertically, with a wider chat frame, and for each mode to have its distinct chat area.

The AI engineer acknowledged this request and initiated changes in  to implement this new layout. Specifically, they started by converting the existing sidebar tab system into a vertical tab system and updating the main content area to accommodate the new tab switching logic and layout. The last recorded action was modifying  to adjust the content area for tab switching logic, which is a foundational step for the requested vertical layout and separate chat sections. This work is ongoing.

The application's core functionality currently involves direct API calls from the React frontend to the external AnythingLLM API (bypassing the FastAPI backend), supporting 6 conversation modes with adjustable prompts, and professional LaTeX math rendering via KaTeX. The previous login and authentication system has been completely removed.

<optional_next_step>
Continue refactoring  to implement the user-requested vertical tab system and adjust the content area for separate chat sections.
