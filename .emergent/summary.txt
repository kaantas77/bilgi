The AI engineer has significantly evolved the BİLGİN application from a basic chat to a sophisticated hybrid AI system. Initially, work focused on UI refinements, chat history, conversation modes, and debugging React state issues. A major effort involved integrating a dynamic RAG system, combining AnythingLLM with web search (Serper API), undergoing multiple iterations to refine trigger logic and fact-checking. Subsequently, comprehensive file and image upload capabilities were added, leveraging OpenAI Vision and various document parsing libraries. A crucial architectural shift was the implementation of a Free/Pro versioning system, intelligently routing queries to different LLM providers (AnythingLLM, OpenAI models like GPT-4o-mini, Gemini, and Ollama) based on the selected version and query type. The trajectory shows extensive debugging and fine-tuning of LLM parameters for accuracy. The immediate pending task is resolving an Ollama workspace not found error for the FREE version integration.

<product_requirements>
The BİLGİN application is an AI-powered chat aiming for a ChatGPT-like experience, built around AnythingLLM. The overarching goal is to provide intelligent, context-aware responses, including current events and document analysis.
Key requirements and their evolution throughout development include:
1.  **UI/UX Enhancements:** Professional LaTeX math rendering, removal of authentication/admin systems for anonymous use, and a UI redesign featuring vertical tabs, a wider chat frame, and distinct Normal Sohbet and Konuşma Modları areas.
2.  **Conversation Management:** Implementation of chat history with summary titles, New Chat, and Delete Chat features. Support for various Konuşma Modları (Friendly, Realistic, Coach, Lawyer, Teacher, Minimalist).
3.  **Intelligent Hybrid AI:** Develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using AnythingLLM, complemented by web search (Serper API). This includes:
    *   Conditional web search: Activated only if AnythingLLM cannot answer directly, asks for more info, or if the query is current/web-dependent (e.g., match scores, news).
    *   AI fact-checking (later removed).
    *   Refined hybrid response combining results, with conditional source attribution.
    *   Intelligent question categorization (casual, math, current, general, technical/creative, chat-style) to route to the most appropriate AI model.
4.  **Content Understanding & Generation:** Enable users to upload PDF, Word, Excel, and image files. The system should process these for summarization, text correction, translation, or analysis. Visual questions posed on images should be resolved using a combination of LLMs and web search. Uploaded files/images should be displayed within the chat messages, not a separate list, and should not persist across new conversations.
5.  **Free/Pro Versioning:** Introduce a user-selectable  and  system. The PRO version maintains the advanced hybrid RAG logic, while the FREE version utilizes different, more cost-effective LLMs (initially Gemini, later Ollama AnythingLLM).
6.  **Error Handling & Localization:** Ensure error messages are properly translated to Turkish and provide robust handling for API failures.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in integrating **Ollama AnythingLLM** for the **FREE version** of the BİLGİN application. The user specifically requested that the  version should utilize Ollama for its responses, providing an API key (). The output from Ollama was to be presented directly without any modification. Additionally, the user requested a minor UI change: the removal of the descriptive text Gemini AI ile üretildi (Generated with Gemini AI) from the Free mode selection on the frontend, leaving only Free Mod.

The AI engineer implemented these changes by:
1.  **Updating **: Adding the  provided by the user.
2.  **Modifying **:
    *   Creating a new asynchronous function, , responsible for making API requests to the Ollama AnythingLLM endpoint ().
    *   Adjusting the  endpoint's logic to direct requests from  users to this new  function. The  header was correctly set with the .
3.  **Modifying **: Removing the specific text Gemini AI ile üretildi from the display associated with the  version in the dropdown menu.

After implementing these code changes and restarting both the backend and frontend services, the  agent was invoked to test the new integration. The test results indicated a failure: NEW OLLAMA ANYTHINGLLM FREE VERSION Integration - Backend routing logic for OllamaAnythingLLM is NOT working as expected. ERROR: Workspace not found on Ollama server. The AI engineer identified that the Workspace not found was the core problem, signaling a need to investigate the correct workspace name or configuration on the Ollama server.
