The AI engineer's work primarily involved evolving the BİLGİN application's chat functionality from a basic MVP to a sophisticated, intelligent hybrid system. Initially, efforts focused on UI refactoring, implementing chat history, and refining conversation modes. Significant time was spent debugging React state management issues, particularly persistent runtime errors and message display failures in . Subsequently, the core task shifted to integrating advanced AI features: a dynamic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system combining AnythingLLM with web search, comprehensive AI fact-checking, and intelligent question categorization. Multiple iterations were made on web search APIs (Google, then Serper, briefly considering OpenAI/Ollama before reverting to Serper), alongside fixing critical frontend-backend communication bypasses. The final stages focused on fine-tuning the hybrid response logic, including source attribution removal and smart routing for casual vs. knowledge-based queries, culminating in a pending fix for an untranslated error message.

<product_requirements>
The BİLGİN application is an AI-powered chat leveraging AnythingLLM, aiming for a ChatGPT-like experience. Initial requirements included core chat, UI/UX, a membership system (later removed), settings, and professional LaTeX math rendering.

Over this trajectory, user requests expanded significantly:
1.  **Enhanced Math Rendering**: Implemented professional LaTeX quality math display.
2.  **Auth/Admin Removal**: Entire membership and admin systems were removed, enabling anonymous chat.
3.  **Conversation Modes**: Implemented Konuşma Modları (Friendly, Realistic, Coach, Lawyer, Teacher, Minimalist) with distinct chat logic.
4.  **Natural Mode Responses**: Refined prompts for more concise, natural responses.
5.  **UI Layout Refactor**: Redesign for vertical tabs, wider chat frame, and separate chat areas for Normal Sohbet and Konuşma Modları.
6.  **Normal Chat History**: Display previous conversations in chronological order, with short summary titles, New Chat and Delete Chat features. Normal Sohbet must not use any modes.
7.  **Hybrid RAG/WebSearch**: Implement web search (Serper API) to complement AnythingLLM. If AnythingLLM lacks information, web search should be utilized.
8.  **AI Fact-Checking**: Verify AnythingLLM's responses using web search, displaying only the validated or corrected answer seamlessly.
9.  **Smart Web Search Routing**: Directly route current/web-dependent queries (e.g., match scores, news) to web search without consulting AnythingLLM.
10. **Refined Hybrid Response**: Always query both AnythingLLM and web search. Clean and combine results, selecting the best answer.
11. **Conditional Source Attribution**: Remove Güncel web kaynaklarından alınmıştır if the answer solely comes from web search.
12. **Intelligent Quick Analysis**: Quickly categorize questions (casual, math, current). For casual/math, use only AnythingLLM. If both sources give the same answer, display it once.

<pending_tasks>
-   Fix the persistent display of the English error message Sorry, Im experiencing technical difficulties." to ensure it is correctly translated to Turkish.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on resolving a critical error message localization issue. Despite previous attempts to implement Turkish error messages, the application was still displaying the English phrase: "Sorry, Im experiencing technical difficulties.

The AI engineer had modified  to include localization logic within the  function and  to ensure error messages were displayed in Turkish. However, upon testing, the English message persisted. The most recent analysis identified the root cause: the regex pattern used for matching and replacing the English error string was not precise enough, allowing the original English message to pass through. The AI engineer has pinpointed this as a string comparison issue and is preparing to apply a more robust fix. This task is directly in line with ensuring a fully localized and user-friendly experience for error handling within the BİLGİN application.
